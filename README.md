I am still a English major student at unversity.
You may have seen my bio and story at [codingdog.xyz](https://www.codingdog.xyz).
I use [zhihu.com](https://zhihu.com/people/qaucodingdog) for publishing ariticals and thoughts more ofen.

💑 By the way, I really like typing front-end codes, especially those with css animations. I've also done some refering [For my special](https://www.codingdog.xyz/iLoveMby). Lots of its code was not wrote by my own though, I picked the usful part of code out and it worked well. By the new year's eve of 2021, I will push the files to github then you guys can see. Good luck.

🐟 My [**MessAround** ](https://github.com/CodingDogzxg/MessAround) repo using for waching videos during work is in updating.

🤑 My [**ZhihuStatistics**](https://github.com/CodingDogzxg/zhihu_stats) readme card generator repo is in updating now! It's awesome! I've already added it up upper in this readme!

🙉 There are two repos help students at my unversity get an easier way to grab classes and evaluate at the end of whichever semester. Two repos:

🐶 [**Grabber**](https://github.com/CodingDogzxg/Grabber-for-QAU) is not in updating now cus I already got full points. If you are interested in this repo and would like to fix bugs, [contact me](mailto:codingdogzxg@gmail.com).

💥 [**Evaluater**](https://github.com/CodingDogzxg/QAUAutoEvaluater) is in updating till I graduate from unversity. This helps students around me a lot, which can evaluate teachers by using TamperMonkey and js in a fast and automatic way without clicking mouse at all.
    
💡 If you find any of my repos helpful, please star the repo to give me more courage.
