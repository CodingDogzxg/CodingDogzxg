## 🚧 Current projects

🐟 My [**MessAround** ](https://github.com/CodingDogzxg/MessAround) repo using for waching videos during work is in updating.

🤑 My [**ZhihuStatistics**](https://github.com/CodingDogzxg/zhihu_stats) readme card generator repo is in updating now! It's awesome! I've already added it upper in this readme!

🙉 There are two repos help students at my university get an easier way to grab classes and evaluate at the end of whichever semester. Two repos:

🐶 [**Grabber**](https://github.com/CodingDogzxg/Grabber-for-QAU) is not in updating now cus I already got full points. If you are interested in this repo and would like to fix bugs, [contact me](mailto:codingdogzxg@gmail.com).

💥 [**Evaluater**](https://github.com/CodingDogzxg/QAUAutoEvaluater) is in updating till I graduate from university. This helps students around me a lot, which can evaluate teachers by using TamperMonkey and js in a fast and automatic way without clicking mouse at all.
    
💡 If you find any of my repos helpful, please star the repo to give me more courage.
